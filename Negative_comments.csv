""I bought Nothing phone. I emailed to return it two days later as it was not for me. They took a week of back and forth and a lengthy form to fill to eventually give me a code to send it back. They have the phone back 17 days now. They emailed just over two weeks ago stating they had the phone for inspection. After a week of asking about my refund they emailed stating I need to pay them ¬£8 before a refund would take place. That a link would be sent to me to pay this. The link could have easily been provided in that email but they seem to be stalling. 

I have now been waiting for the link for 9 days. I email pretty much daily now and even gone to Citizen advise followed by Trading standards once it amounts to 30 days. Not sure if they are waiting for the 30 days for a chunk of interest from all our money or is they have cash flow issues but they have now stopped communicating with me and I have no refund. They have no way of calling them either but I have found an address in London.""

""nothing - """"lets steal the whole design and feel of the iPhone 12, but make the back beautiful and transparent with useless LED's so that it will look """"original""""""""
i mean c'mon, you can't say that this doesn't look like an iPhone 12 with a transparent back and LED strips...
that's not to say it doesn't look good, but everyone's craze about the look of this phone is ridiculous...
these LED strips are just a stupid gimmick - just like how """"gaming"""" phones have RGB strips on their back, it looks cool but DESTROYS battery life.
the only thing i think is actually unique about this nothing phone is that for 400$ they made the extra effort of using a foldable OLED panel to fold the display electronics board and have even bezels around the screen.
that's the only good """"feature"""" this phone has.
it has pretty mediocre low end specs, it visually looks like an iPhone 12 on steroids and it is being hyped by everyone because of what it looks like rather than what's the new and unique features it brings to the smartphone world - IT BRINGS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING (no pun intended).
gosh, the amount of hype for nothing is so darn stupid it makes me think that the whole tech world has gone retarded.
in the past 4 years the smartphone space has not changed not even a single bit - take ANY phone from 4 years ago and place it right alongside a phone that just came out this year and show it to someone that doesn't know when both phones were released and i bet you 100% that this person couldn't tell which phone is from 4 years ago and which is brand new, hell he might actually think that both phones are brand new.

anyone who has any iphone / android flagship phone from 4 years ago and still uses it can be rest assured that they are missing absolutely nothing new AT ALL.
this sucks because even foldable didn't change AT ALL in the past 4 years - and remember, foldable were """"THE FUTURE"""" 4 years ago but now 4 years later, foldable still have the same exact fundamental problems that they had 4 years ago when they first started to pop out - and despite what everyone was thinking 4 years ago foldable STILL cost an arm and a leg..""

""There's nothing new under the sun. HTC tried transparent back covers on the U12+, and got uniformly mocked for it. HTC also had tried interesting lighting effects with the dot view cover, and it was mocked as a gimmick. We'll see if Pei gets better treatment from the tech press. Killer camera is a necessity nowadays, the mediocre Essential Phone camera was the main reason it failed""

""Nothing is a whole marketing bullshit. The damn thing is another Android phone as the rest and ‚ÄûNothing‚Äú more, ha ‚Ä¶ ha ‚Ä¶ ha ‚Ä¶.
And I find the pre order methods of this company ridiculous and too complicated. They make the phone special fictitious. But it‚Äôs not special, have you seen the specs of this phone? They are not special.
And then they claim to deliver ‚Äûthe extra nothing feel to this‚Äú.
This is a perfect example how to manipulate the dumb mass and how to make money out of it, only with marketing and not a good over the average line product.
Don‚Äôt be so silly and buy this thing only based of the marketing they make. They are laughing at the consumers.""

Also what the fuck is up with these shitty ringtones? Couldn't they have found anyone, even someone off Fiverr to make some that actually sound good. I would be embarrassed for people to hear those ringtones in public.""
