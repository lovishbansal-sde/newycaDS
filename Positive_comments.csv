Very interesting phone I love the unique packaging as well as the backlights

I had no intention of getting a new phone. Planned on waiting until my s9+ died before upgrading but that white nothing is tempting. No idea if its stats are better tho 😆

white its so cool and better the black look witha a simple black phone

a black charger with the black one would be cool tho lol

""Stop wasting people's time and money in buying thing they don't need and recommending phones that you don't use. Everyone knows iphones are the best and everyone wants to eventually buy that only. Every tech channel is recommending Korean or Chinese phones, whereas in reality all of them use an iPhone. A middle class income guy like me, can only buy/ keep one phone for 2 to 3 years. No one can change their phones, everytime a new phones is showcased or reviewed by these tech channels.""

""I got the 12gm RAM model and I can't wait for it to come in. I've been less and less demanding towards my phone's hardware lately.

So it immediately clicked between me and nothing (1).""

The love the black one . I just wish reviewers would show the difference in brightness on the LED lights . I ordered the black one and will most likely adjust the LED brightness to not too bright depending where I'm at .

Affordable wireless charging phone does sound nice the tech specs are no different from my BlackShark 4 pro which has more battery life this needs a turbo charger if anything.

I owned a Xiaomi Redmi. I paid less than $200 for it but it haven’t gotten that much support despite Xiaomi supports their phone longer than other Android competitors. And the quality wasn’t that great neither even for a late 2017 standard and the phone seemed to get slower over time. Got an iPhone XR now and couldn’t be happier since I know the phone will be support for long. So you have to be very careful when buying cheap phones from these companies since probably they won’t have that much commitment to their products maybe partly due to their size or profit reason.
"

""Just waiting for the camera and battery performance, and i'm good to go. I'll buy it. Looks pretty damn good and well priced (approx. 32k due to local manufacturing in Chennai, India) compared to Oneplus's high end ones.

Edit: After watching so many reviews at this point, i'll stick with a Samsung for now since Pixel 6a sucked as expected. 
This Nothing sucked as well. Glyph interface causes the battery to drain fast by almost 1 hour which is a big NO NO for me. Many reviewers were unable to connect this phone to a laptop even after usb debugging. Overall, can't put too much faith on a completely new brand as a daily usable gadget. For now.""
