After a week of asking about my refund they emailed stating I need to pay them ¬£8 before a refund would take place. That a link would be sent to me to pay this. The link could have easily been provided in that email but they seem to be stalling. 
I have now been waiting for the link for 9 days. I email pretty much daily now and even gone to Citizen advise followed by Trading standards once it amounts to 30 days. Not sure if they are waiting for the 30 days for a chunk of interest from all our money or is they have cash flow issues but they have now stopped communicating with me and I have no refund.

"nothing - ""lets steal the whole design and feel of the iPhone 12, but make the back beautiful and transparent with useless LED's so that it will look ""original""""
i mean c'mon, you can't say that this doesn't look like an iPhone 12 with a transparent back and LED strips...
that's not to say it doesn't look good, but everyone's craze about the look of this phone is ridiculous...
these LED strips are just a stupid gimmick - just like how ""gaming"" phones have RGB strips on their back, it looks cool but DESTROYS battery life.
the only thing i think is actually unique about this nothing phone is that for 400$ they made the extra effort of using a foldable OLED panel to fold the display electronics board and have even bezels around the screen.
that's the only good ""feature"" this phone has.
it has pretty mediocre low end specs, it visually looks like an iPhone 12 on steroids and it is being hyped by everyone because of what it looks like rather than what's the new and unique features it brings to the smartphone world - IT BRINGS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING (no pun intended).
gosh, the amount of hype for nothing is so darn stupid it makes me think that the whole tech world has gone retarded.
in the past 4 years the smartphone space has not changed not even a single bit - take ANY phone from 4 years ago and place it right alongside a phone that just came out this year and show it to someone that doesn't know when both phones were released and i bet you 100% that this person couldn't tell which phone is from 4 years ago and which is brand new, hell he might actually think that both phones are brand new.

anyone who has any iphone / android flagship phone from 4 years ago and still uses it can be rest assured that they are missing absolutely nothing new AT ALL.
this sucks because even foldable didn't change AT ALL in the past 4 years - and remember, foldable were ""THE FUTURE"" 4 years ago but now 4 years later, foldable still have the same exact fundamental problems that they had 4 years ago when they first started to pop out - and despite what everyone was thinking 4 years ago foldable STILL cost an arm and a leg.."

I owned a Xiaomi Redmi. I paid less than $200 for it but it haven‚Äôt gotten that much support despite Xiaomi supports their phone longer than other Android competitors. And the quality wasn‚Äôt that great neither even for a late 2017 standard and the phone seemed to get slower over time. Got an iPhone XR now and couldn‚Äôt be happier since I know the phone will be support for long. So you have to be very careful when buying cheap phones from these companies since probably they won‚Äôt have that much commitment to their products maybe partly due to their size or profit reason.

"Just waiting for the camera and battery performance, and i'm good to go. I'll buy it. Looks pretty damn good and well priced (approx. 32k due to local manufacturing in Chennai, India) compared to Oneplus's high end ones.

Edit: After watching so many reviews at this point, i'll stick with a Samsung for now since Pixel 6a sucked as expected. 
This Nothing sucked as well. Glyph interface causes the battery to drain fast by almost 1 hour which is a big NO NO for me. Many reviewers were unable to connect this phone to a laptop even after usb debugging. Overall, can't put too much faith on a completely new brand as a daily usable gadget. For now."
